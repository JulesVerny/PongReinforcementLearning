## Pong Game Reinforcement Learning ##
Deep DQN Based Reinforcement Learning for simple Pong PyGame.  This python based RL experiment plays a Py Pong Game (DQN control of Left Hand Yellow Paddle against a programmed RHS Paddle)

The Objective is simply measured as successfully returning of the Ball by the Yellow RL DQN Agent.  
The programmed opponent player is a pretty hot player. So success as is simply the  ability to return ball served from Serena Williams.
The Moving Average Score is calculated in range from [-10, +10] from Complete failure to return the balls, to full success in returning the Ball. This experiment demonstrates DQN based Reinforcement Learning Agent, which improves from poor performace ~ -9.0 towards reasonably good ~ +9.0 (Fluctuating) return rate in around 10,000 game update cycles. The Agent employs Direct game Features [ Paddle Y, Ball X, Y and Ball X, Y Directions feeding into DQN Nueral net Estimator of the Q[S,A] function. 

This is NOT a Convolutional Network based RL [based Game Video Frame states, because in my experience CN's takes much too Long to Learn on standard PCs: GPUs] and so unfortunately this is Game Specific DQN Reinforecment Learning, and cannot be generalised to other Games like Deep minds ATARI game approach based upon Convolutional Network layers.
