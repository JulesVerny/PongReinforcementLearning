#  MyPong DQN Reinforcement Learning Experiment
#
#  Plays Pong Game (DQN control of Left Hand Yellow Paddle)
#  Objective is simply measured as succesfully returning of the Ball 
#  The programed oponent player is a pretty hot player. Imagine success as being able to return ball served from Serena Williams)
#  Moving Average Score from [-10, +10] from Complete failure to return the balls, to full success in returning the Ball.
#
#  This Reinforcement learning employs Direct Features [ Paddle Y, Ball X, Y and Ball X,Y Directions feeding into DQN Nueral net Estimator of Q[S,A] function.
#  So this is NOT a Convolutional Network based RL, based Game Video Frame states [Which in my experience takes much too Long to Learn on standard PCs] 
#  So unfortunaly this is Game Specific DQN Reinforecment Learning, and cannot be generalised to other games. Requires specific Features to be identified. 
#      
# This experiment demonstrates DQN based agent, improves from poor performace ~ 5.0 towards reasonably good +8.0 (Fluctuating) 
# return rate in around 15,000 game cycles [Not returns]
#
#  The  code is based upon Siraj Raval's inspiring vidoes on Machine learning and Reinforcement Learning [ Which is full convolutional DQN example] 
#  https://github.com/llSourcell/pong_neural_network_live
# 
#  requires pygame, numpy, matplotlib, keras [and hence Tensorflow or Theono backend]
